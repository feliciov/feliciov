### Hello!
I'm Fel√≠cio and I do **data related work**. :chart_with_upwards_trend::microscope:

Most of my work is done in Python using VS Code (I like my devcontainers) on a Debian or Arch Linux distro :crossed_swords:.

Often, I'll explore using jupyter and on the topmost cell of my notebooks you will likely see the following
```python
import pandas as pd               # pretty much garantee
import geopandas as gpd           # whenever geodata is part of the analysis 
import numpy as np                # there's always something usefull comming from np

# one of the following
import altair as alt              # goto charting lib, whenever data allows me
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt   # for static charts
import bokeh                      # interactive geo charting, mostly

# not so often, but still quite common
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession # if I have access to some resources (and It's needed)
```
If the need for statistical modeling arises, I'll likely resort to `sklearn`, `statsmodels` or `pysal`. I've done some NLP work with `spacy` and built deep learning with `tf.keras`, but not for long.

I'm also doing *noninteractive* coding. I'll code `kedro` pipelines, `fastapi` APIs or even `panel` and `streamlit` dashboards if the situation calls for it.<br>
I've maped and CRUD databases with `sqlalchemy` and `tortoise`, but lately I'm more of a data consumer using pandas's `read_sql_query` or (indirectly) kedro's `SQLQueryDataSet`.<br>
I'll test it up with `pytest`.

I've done webscrapping projects with both `selenium` and `scrapy` + splash.

If you think I can help you, feel free to mail me. The address is at my [github page cover](https://feliciov.github.io).
